Requirements analysis
System design by UML modelling
System implementation in Java using object-oriented design
System testing
SDLC Methodology
The spiral model has been chosen as the preferred methodology for this project due to its emphasis on creating multiple prototypes and iterations that go through the same checkpoints throughout development, allowing for flexibility and minimization of risk.
